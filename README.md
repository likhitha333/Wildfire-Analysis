The goal of this project is to give stakeholders in wildfire management useful insights by presenting a framework for visualizing wildfire data. The framework serves the needs of firefighters, community members, GIS analysts, environmental researchers, government officials, and data analysts by utilizing comprehensive wildfire data that includes fire occurrences, causes, and geographic information. Stakeholders can obtain useful insights regarding fire patterns, spatial distribution, and contributing causes by utilizing a variety of visualization tools, including interactive maps, stacked bar graphs, line charts, bar graphs, and map charts. To effectively handle the issues posed by wildfires, the framework makes it easier to make educated decisions, allocate resources, organize interventions, and formulate policies.
